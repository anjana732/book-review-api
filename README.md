## üìÆ API Endpoints
### üîê Auth Routes

- POST  **`/api/auth/signup`**: Registers a new user by creating an account with the provided credentials and stores the user information in the MongoDB database.
  
- POST **`/api/auth/login`**  : Authenticates the user using the provided email and password. If the credentials are valid, the server responds with a short-lived access token (valid for 15 minutes) and a refresh token (valid for 7 days).
  - The access token is returned in the response body and must be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token to access protected routes.
  - The refresh token is securely stored in an HttpOnly cookie to prevent XSS attacks. It is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
    
- POST **`/api/auth/refresh-token`** : Generates a new access token using a valid refresh token. Upon successful verification of the refresh token, a new access token is issued.

## üîë Authentication

This API uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication. Use Postman to run the followinf endpoints.

### üßæ Steps to Authenticate:

1. **Register a New User**

Select the POST method and paste the following URL into the URL section of Postman:
```bash
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup  
```
In the `Body tab`, select `raw` and choose `JSON format`, then provide the following example payload:

```json
{
  "username": "<your_username>",
  "email": "<your_email@example.com>",
  "password": "<your_password>"
}
```
**Sample example**

<img src="/Asset/signup.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="800" height="400">


2. **Login**

Select the POST method and paste the following URL into the URL section of Postman:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login  
```
In the `Body tab`, select `raw` and choose `JSON format`, then provide the following example payload:

```json
{
  "email": "<your_email@example.com>",
  "password": "<your_password>"
}
```
**Sample example**

<img src="/Asset/login.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="800" height="400">

**Sample example**

<img src="/Asset/AccessToken.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="800" height="400">

4. **Generate access token from refresh token**
