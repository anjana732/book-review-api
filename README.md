## üìÆ API Endpoints
### üîê Auth Routes

- POST  **`/api/auth/signup`**: Registers a new user by creating an account with the provided credentials and stores the user information in the MongoDB database.
  
- POST **`/api/auth/login`**  : Authenticates the user using the provided email and password. If the credentials are valid, the server responds with a short-lived access token (valid for 15 minutes) and a refresh token (valid for 7 days).
  - The access token is returned in the response body and must be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token to access protected routes.
  - The refresh token is securely stored in an HttpOnly cookie to prevent XSS attacks. It is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
    
- POST **`/api/auth/refresh-token`** : Generates a new access token using a valid refresh token. Upon successful verification of the refresh token, a new access token is issued.
